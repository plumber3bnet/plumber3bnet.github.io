<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Everyday usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you ought to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
