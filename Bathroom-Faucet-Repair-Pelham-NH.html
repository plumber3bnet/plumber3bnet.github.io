<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent efficiency of research study, vacuum, and commercial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure includes finish Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leaks and corrosion within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier in between the inside of the material and the pipe streaming through it. This repair approach is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
