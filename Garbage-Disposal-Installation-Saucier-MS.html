<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
