<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
