<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
