<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or momentary connection between a public water supply or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working successfully due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use increasingly more detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regrowth. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
