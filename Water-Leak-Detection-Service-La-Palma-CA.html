<p>Examining the condition, age, and water lines to the water heater can help plumbers understand numerous things, including water pressure and indications of leakages. It can likely last beyond its basic service warranty if the water heater has been kept with annual flush service.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
