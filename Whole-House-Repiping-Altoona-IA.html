<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
