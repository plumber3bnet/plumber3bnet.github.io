Toilets differ in design, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more costly than others. When installing a brand-new toilet, the plumber might also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
