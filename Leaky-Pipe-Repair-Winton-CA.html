<h3>Blocked Sink in Winton California</h2>

<p>Use the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several houses in my area being repiped and have actually spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't discovered soon, obviously it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
