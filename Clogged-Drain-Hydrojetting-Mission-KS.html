<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You ought to wait until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You need to also inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
