Cooking Grease: Cooking grease must never be thrown down the kitchen drain. While it might decrease as a liquid, as it cools it can become strong, finishing your pipes in the process.

There's often confusion about whether National Fire Defense Association (NFPA) requirements require backflow preventers on fire protection systems. Let's be clear: they do not.

<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can create major drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the problem for normal home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to further damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is happening to your home.</p>
