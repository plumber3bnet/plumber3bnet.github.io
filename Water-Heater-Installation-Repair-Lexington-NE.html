When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
