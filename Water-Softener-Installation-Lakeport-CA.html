<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
