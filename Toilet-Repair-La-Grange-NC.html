<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you ought to most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
