The direct exposure to carbon monoxide is so fatal that anybody who inhales it requires immediate medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 individuals died from carbon monoxide poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this disaster, ensure to use your gas ranges exactly as instructed and never ever to utilize them to warm your home.
