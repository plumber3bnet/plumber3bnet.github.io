<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for the majority of construction contractors (or their staff members).

If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
