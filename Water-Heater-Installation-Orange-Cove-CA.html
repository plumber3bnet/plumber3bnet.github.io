<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
