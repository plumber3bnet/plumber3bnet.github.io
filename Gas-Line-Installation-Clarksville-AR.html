<h3>Copper Pipe Repair in Clarksville Arkansas</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
