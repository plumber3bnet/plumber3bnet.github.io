More complex problems with water temperature or pressure might require replacing the hot water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, you might have a farmhouse or apron sink, a bar sink, an undermount sink, or a cast iron sink, maybe with an enamel plating.
