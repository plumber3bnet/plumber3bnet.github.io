<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
