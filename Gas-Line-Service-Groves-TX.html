<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Groves TX</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>
