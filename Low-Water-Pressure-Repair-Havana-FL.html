<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief.

This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas.

As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer.
