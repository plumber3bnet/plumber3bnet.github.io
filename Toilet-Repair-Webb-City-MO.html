<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It is very important to see what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause jams and blockages - consider composting or positioning these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and congeal in your drain too. After completing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly location in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
