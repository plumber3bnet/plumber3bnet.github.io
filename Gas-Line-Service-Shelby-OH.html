<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
