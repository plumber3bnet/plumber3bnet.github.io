It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
