<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.
