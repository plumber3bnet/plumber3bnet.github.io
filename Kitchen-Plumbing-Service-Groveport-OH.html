If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
