<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70.

<p>Some house owners may think of water softeners as a high-end product, something that's great to have" however not altogether essential. However, tough water can cause whatever from minor annoyances, like areas on dishes or soap residue, to major problems like a much shorter lifespan for your water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary house devices. For these factors and others, a water softener can be a helpful financial investment for your home.</p>
<p>Some softeners deal with electrical power, however some more recent water softeners utilize waterpower.
