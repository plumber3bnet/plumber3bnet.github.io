<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
