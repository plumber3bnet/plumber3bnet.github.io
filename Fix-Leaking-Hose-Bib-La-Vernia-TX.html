<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next step would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a bucket beneath the area to catch water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in location. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
