<p>Water hardness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make certain to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
