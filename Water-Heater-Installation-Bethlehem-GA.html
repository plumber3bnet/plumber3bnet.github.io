<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
