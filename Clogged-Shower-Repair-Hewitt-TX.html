<p>The very best method to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure minimizing valve (PRV).

According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can likewise help to save water as components in the house will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
