Some homeowners will try to dislodge the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda.

Initially, plans for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might take up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process. Declined strategies must be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
