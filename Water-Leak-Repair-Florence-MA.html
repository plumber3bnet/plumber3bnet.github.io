<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly flow toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or irreversible connection between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
