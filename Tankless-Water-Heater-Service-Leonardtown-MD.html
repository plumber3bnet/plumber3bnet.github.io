<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause jams and obstructions - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can cake and gather in your drain as well.
