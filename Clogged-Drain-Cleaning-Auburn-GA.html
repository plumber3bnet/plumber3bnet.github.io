<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Lots of house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their filthy or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to utilize and low-cost, but they damage your pipes and their effects are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe developing weak spots that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
