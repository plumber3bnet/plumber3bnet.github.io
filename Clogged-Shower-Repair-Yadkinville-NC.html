<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging task due to the fact that of the age of your home and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left.
