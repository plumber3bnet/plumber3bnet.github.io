Standard tank hot water heater: These water heaters are typically powered by gas or electrical energy. They hold 20 to 100 gallons of water, depending upon the needs of your household.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification.
