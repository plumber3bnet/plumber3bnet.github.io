<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
