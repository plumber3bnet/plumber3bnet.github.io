<p>To identify if your house is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it gets in the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
