<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
