<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream might trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
