<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
