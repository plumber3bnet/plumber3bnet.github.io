<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

Another risk in sewer repair projects is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too essential to run the risk of in a DIY sewer job! Avoid these security dangers by working with a professional plumber.</p>
