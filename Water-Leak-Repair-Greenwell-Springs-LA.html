<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
