Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is set up.

<p>Whether you have a waste disposal unit and it's not working properly, or if it's finally time to install one in your house, a waste disposal unit is a previous high-end that is nearly a necessity in these times. Always continue to run water throughout and after utilizing your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has disappeared down the drain.</p>
