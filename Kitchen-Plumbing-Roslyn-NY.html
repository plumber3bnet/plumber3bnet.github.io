<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Roslyn NY 11576</h3>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Typically caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve may activate intermittently, as well.
