<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
