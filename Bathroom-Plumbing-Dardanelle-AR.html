Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a fixture can trigger destructive damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
