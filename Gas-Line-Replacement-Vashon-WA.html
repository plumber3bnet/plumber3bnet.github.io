It is very important that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
