<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
