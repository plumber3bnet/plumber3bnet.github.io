<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

However the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
