<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
