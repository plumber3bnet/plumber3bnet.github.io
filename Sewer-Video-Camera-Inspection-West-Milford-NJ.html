<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
